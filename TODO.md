## Simple Memory Patches
Memory patches are simple to implement, since they can be implemented with a simple `kmWriteX`, where `X` is the type of integer that the code patches.

## C2 Codes
C2 codes are more difficult to implement than memory patches, since they insert assembly code.

## Other
- [x] 200cc Brake Drifting in all CCs
- [ ] Implement [WiiLink WFC](https://wfc.wiilink24.com)
- [ ] Integration with [GhostDB](https://github.com/yomcube/GhostDB/)
	- This won't happen until GhostDB is finished. MKW-SP will have a higher integration priority, so integrating with Pulsar will have to wait until then.
- [ ] Make Minimap Toggable
- [ ] Make ZL Button Wheelie Button
- [ ] Settings while Pause Menu
- [ ] Silver trophies (beginner staff ghosts)
- [ ] That Option to change between Inside and Outside Drift Variety Pack has
- [ ] The Volume Controls from MKW-SP
	- MKW-SP has an entirely different system than Pulsar.
- [ ] [TTs Online](https://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/TTs_Online)
- [ ] **[Large project]** Custom Wii Channel
- [ ] **[Large project]** Homebrew Updater (Like OptPack)
- [ ] ***[Extremely large project]*** Local Multiplayer Time Trials
    - Unrealistic. Nobody has ever made this and will never happen unless someone is willing to make it.


### Toggable
- [ ] An Input Display from MKW-SP
    - MKW-SP has an entirely different system than Pulsar.
- [ ] CC Changes (Normal, 300CC, 500CC, 1000CC)
