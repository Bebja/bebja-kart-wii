## Simple Memory Patches
Memory patches are simple to implement, since they can be implemented with a simple `kmWriteX`, where `X` is the type of integer that the code patches.

## C2 Codes
C2 codes are more difficult to implement than memory patches, since they insert assembly code.

- [ ] Beginner staff ghosts
    - Poor design choice, as explained below. Nevertheless, it could be added.
      >  it is likely that many Pulsar packs get made in the future, and therefore the sheer number of staff ghosts would mean most do not get beat, making beginner staff ghosts more of a negative than a positive, as on every pack you would have to first beat these ghosts to even unlock the myriad of experts.

- [ ] Integration with [GhostDB](https://github.com/yomcube/GhostDB/)
    - This won't happen until GhostDB is finished. MKW-SP will have a higher integration priority, so integrating with Pulsar will have to wait until then.
